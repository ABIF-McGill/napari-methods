# napari-methods

<br>

napari-methods is a tool still under development to help collect and report microscopy metadata in napari, based on our previous metadata collection and reporting tool [MethodsJ2 for Fiji.](https://github.com/ABIF-McGill/MethodsJ2)

<br>

napari-methods requires napari, as well as an image file and a corresponding microscope specifications file generated in [Micro-Meta App.](https://github.com/WU-BIMAC/MicroMetaApp-Electron/releases/tag/1.2.2-b1-1)

<br>

Generally, users will be able to open an image in napari, and select a Micro-Meta app hardware specifications file. Then, the user will be prompted to input critical metadata information in order to document the imaging experiment, and the plugin will help generate a microscope methods text suitable for a manuscript.
